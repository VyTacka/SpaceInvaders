This Space Invaders clone is only for fun and studying purposes of applying design patterns.

It is created using Java with Swing and AWT.

## Plot
The plot of the game is simple. Aliens are invading Earth and it is your job to defend your home planet from the 3 types of decending Invaders before they destroy you or touch the ground.

## Gameplay
In Space Invaders you control the Core Cannon, which moves horizontally across the screen firing at aliens. The aim is to shoot all of the aliens in 5 rows of 11. They move back and forth and every time they complete and get back to where they started they move down one row. They goal is to reach the ground (Earth) and invade, for which then the player loses.

## Trivia
- Originaly, the invaders where ment to be soldiers. But they where changed to aliens to avoid any controversies.
